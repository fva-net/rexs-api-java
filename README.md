# REXS-API

The REXS API library contains core utility classes for the REXS interface.

ATTENTION: The current status of the REXS API is not yet fully covered by Javadoc and unit tests. For this reason we cannot publish a first major version yet. Before using this stand productively, you should therefore test sufficiently.
